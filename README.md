# slide-templates


The goal of this repository is to provide all the rstudio::conf slide templates for Keynote, PowerPoint, and R Markdown-based [slides](https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/slide-templates/xaringan/index.html) (currently only through the [xaringan package](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan)) for instructors who would like them. These are **optional** - you do not have to use any of these! We are providing them as options, based on instructor requests for slide theme help and guidance. So if you are looking for someone else to design a slide theme for you, then you are in the right place.

If you have suggestions, additions, or edits, please feel empowered to make a PR.
